## The Challenge

Skillab was designed for PT. Education Technology Digital, an edutech company that offers various online courses to develop digital talent in Indonesia. However, PT. Education Technology Digital faced a decrease in revenue and identified several pain points that needed to be addressed:

1.  Users were not satisfied with the platform's user interface.
2.  The platform was complicated to navigate and use.
3.  Loading times were significantly long.
4.  Users struggled to find motivation for learning.

To overcome these challenges, PT. Education Technology Digital decided to revamp its platform and make it more user-friendly with an attractive design that would enhance the learning motivation of its users.

## The Target Users

Skillab is designed for users aged 18-55 years, working professionals in Indonesia, with at least a middle-class economic background. By focusing on this target audience, Skillab aims to provide a personalized learning experience that meets their specific needs and preferences.

## The Design Process

### Define and Ideate

To start the design process, our team analyzed the pain points and identified how we could address them. We brainstormed and came up with several solution ideas, such as a responsive and user-friendly interface, easy communication with mentors, gamified learning experiences, simplicity in usability, and opportunities for knowledge sharing among users.

Based on the pain points and solution ideas, we formulated the following "How-Might-We" questions:

1.  How might we create a user-friendly and responsive interface to enhance accessibility to learning materials?
2.  How might we facilitate easy communication and consultation with mentors?
3.  How might we incorporate gamification elements to make learning more engaging?
4.  How might we ensure simplicity and familiarity in the platform's usability?
5.  How might we enable users to discuss and share knowledge with other learners?
6.  How might we enable offline learning?

From these ideas, we prioritized the most pressing issue, which was the lack of user motivation, unsatisfactory user interface, and complexity in navigation.

### Solution Idea

Next, we generated solution ideas that aligned with the identified pain points and "How-Might-We" questions. We aimed to create a prototype that would address these challenges and enhance the learning experience. To gather a diverse range of ideas, we engaged in brainstorming sessions without limiting our creativity.

### Affinity Diagram

To organize and categorize the generated ideas, we used an affinity diagram. This helped us identify clusters of ideas and find common threads among them. By grouping similar ideas, we were able to pinpoint the most relevant solutions for our target audience.

### Prioritization

With a comprehensive list of solution ideas, we prioritized them based on effort required and user value. This ensured that the most important features were given priority during the development phase.

### Crazy 8

To further refine our ideas, each team member had 8 minutes to create 8 low-fidelity wireframe sketches. Afterward, we voted on the best sketches that captured the essence of our solutions. These selected sketches were then developed into more detailed low-fidelity wireframes.

## The Design Phase

With the ideas and concepts in place, we moved on to the design phase. Here are the four key steps we followed:

1.  _User Flow_: We created a simplified user flow, ensuring that users would not encounter unnecessary complexities.
2.  _Wireframe_: Using the user flow as a guide, we developed low-fidelity wireframes to explore different design options and determine the information hierarchy.
3.  _UI Design System_: We established a UI design system to maintain consistency throughout the application, including colors, typography, and buttons.
4.  _Mockups and Prototypes_: Finally, we created high-fidelity mockups and interactive prototypes to visualize the final product and simulate user interactions.

## Conclusion

Skillab is the result of an extensive UX design process aimed at enhancing the learning experience. By addressing pain points such as user motivation, unsatisfactory user interface, and complexity in navigation, Skillab provides an easy and engaging way to improve your skills.
