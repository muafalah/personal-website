## Problem Summary

The main problem we identified was the imbalance between the number of mentors and students in online courses. This often led to limited interaction between mentors and individual students. To address this issue, we aimed to develop a Mentor On Demand service with the following key features:

1.  Registration for potential mentors
2.  Student ability to choose and view mentor profiles and fees
3.  Payment page
4.  Concise mentor profile information

## Objectives

Based on the identified problem, our team established the following objectives:

1.  Help students choose mentors and topics based on their needs
2.  Assist students in deepening their understanding of certain topics through mentorship
3.  Design an easy-to-use mentor on demand service

## Design Process

We followed the Design Thinking framework for this project. The process consisted of the following stages:

### 1. Empathize

In the Empathize stage, we conducted research to gain a deeper understanding of the problem. We analyzed competitor platforms, studied user feedback, and analyzed the challenge brief provided by Skilvul. Through this research, we were able to identify the core issues faced by users.

### 2. Define

Once we understood the users' pain points, we focused on defining the specific problems they were facing. We considered the perspectives of both students and mentors to ensure a comprehensive understanding of the challenges they encountered.

### 3. Ideate

During the Ideate stage, we brainstormed various solution ideas to address the defined problems. We clustered these ideas based on their similarities and relevance to the user needs. The ideas were then prioritized based on effort and user value.

### 4. Prototype

In the Prototype stage, we transformed the selected ideas into low-fidelity wireframes. This allowed us to explore the design concept and determine the information that needed to be displayed. We also created user flows to outline the important processes involved in the Mentor On Demand service.

## Conclusion

Through the Skilvul Challenge: Mentor On Demand UX Case Study, we aimed to create a platform that would connect students with mentors efficiently. Our solution focused on enabling students to choose mentors based on their needs, providing flexible mentoring services, and ensuring a seamless user experience.

The design process followed the Design Thinking framework, allowing us to deeply understand the problem, generate innovative ideas, and prototype a functional solution.

Overall, the Mentor On Demand project proved to be a valuable learning experience and an opportunity to apply UX design principles in a real-world context.
